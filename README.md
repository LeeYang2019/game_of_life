## Description

## Goals

# The following are goals I learned from the project:

        Learn how methods improve code by making it modular and task-oriented.
        Implement a program that uses multiple static methods.
        Implement methods that call other methods.
        Practice passing arguments to methods.
        Practice returning values from methods.
        Develop code using two-dimensional arrays.
        Practice modifying arrays within methods.
